<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
Peanuts are the most water-efficient nut. It takes 4.8 gallons of water to produce one ounce of peanuts when it takes roughly 80 gallons of water to grow one ounce of almonds. Peanut plants use less water to grow due to their compact plant structure and underground fruiting. Their roots also replenish the essential nitrogen in the soil that is depleted by other crops. This means that farmers will use less fertilizer to grow peanuts and the next season’s crop, such as cotton.
