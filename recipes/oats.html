<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
If you can afford some milk, or a drop of vinegar, or if you have some hot water; the noble oats can avoid starvation when you are short in a budget.
<p>As any other grain, oats requires something acid, soaking, or some cooking to be in the best edible condition. This is why since ancient times we mix grains with another ingredient. Rice and soy sauce. Bread and tomato sauce for pizza. Tortilla and salsa.</p>

<H5>INGREDIENTS</H5>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup (250 mL) of milk</li>
    <li>½ cup (45 grams) of rolled oats</li>
    <li>Salt (optional)</li>
</ul>

<H5>STEPS TO PREPARE OATS</H5>
<ol>
    <li>Mix 1 cup (250 mL) of milk and ½ cup (45 grams) of rolled oats into a bowl. Measure the rolled oats and milk into a microwave-safe bowl that can hold at least 2 cups (500 mL) of liquid. Stir the rolled oats and milk with a spoon until they are thoroughly combined.
    Multiply the ingredients by the number of people you are serving. For example, if you are serving 4 people, add 4 portions of each ingredient.
    Add a pinch of salt, if desired.</li>

    <li>Microwave the oats on high for 1-5 minutes. Place the bowl of oats into the microwave and set the microwave to cook on the hottest setting. Heat quick or instant oats for 1 1/2 minutes and rolled or old-fashioned oats for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.Cook steel-cut oats for 5 minutes.</li>

    <li>Stir the cooked oats. Remove the cooked oats from the microwave and use a spoon to stir the mixture until the liquid is evenly distributed through the oats.
    <ul>
        <li>Use an oven mitt when touching the hot bowl to avoid burns.</li>
        <li>Leave the oats to cool until they are your desired temperature.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
